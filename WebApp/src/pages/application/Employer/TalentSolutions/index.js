              White Collar & Blue Collar experienced casual staff are available on an
              hourly hire basis from as little as four hours through to a permanent
              casual all year-round arrangement. Ideal for coverage of sick leave,
              maternity leave, annual leave or simply just to cover peaks in
              workflow. Whether it's a last-minute emergency or a planned staffing
              requirement WhiteCollarBlue has casual staff ready to help you.
              <br />
              <br />
              Utilising Casuals Full Time onsite is a great way to identify possible
              Talent that you may want to consider for permanent positions you have
              vacant within your organisation. Our Temporary with view to Permanent
              service is a popular option for most companies that are looking to
              recruit permanent staff but want to minimise the Risks, Costs and
              Exposure which too often comes from a wrong hiring decision.
              WhiteCollarBlue will recruit a casual employee who meets the personal
              and position profile criteria for the permanent vacancy you have
              available, advising the candidate of the potential for the position to
              go permanent dependant on their suitability. We will payroll the casual
              for an agreed trial period (after which no fee will be applicable if
              you decide to make an offer) allowing you to assess their suitability
              before the possible offer of permanent employment.

            <p>
              Utilising Fixed Term contract staff for project work is very similar to
              the flexibility of casual staff, you still have the same flexibility
              but the difference in the mindset of the casual project staff knowing
              they have a commitment from you for as fixed term unlike the
              uncertainty of a casual assignment will mean you will get greater
              engagement for longer allowing consistency of productivity and
              minimisation of the effects and costs of casual staff turnover through
              the uncertainty of work duration by the project staff as they are more
              likely to be more engaged through greater certainty around project
              timelines. <br />
              <br />
              Generally with Projects you know well in advance of the likely start
              thereby giving us the required time to source a strong well skilled
              team for the project that otherwise would not be available on short
              notice when requesting talent for immediate casual requirements - The
              more time you give us to recruit for projects, the stronger the
              workforce we can build for you.
