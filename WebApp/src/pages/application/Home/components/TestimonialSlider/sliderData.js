        We\'ve had a lot of companies approach us and try to work with us over the years but WCB are the best to deal with.\
        They are always professional and persistent in finding suitable candidates. We\'ve been able to secure 2 really good permanent candidates with them.\
        We appreciate the support over the years and are glad to have a good partnership with WCB. The partnership has been a beneficial one.\
        Being a smaller co, we hope to grow with this partnership and hope the same for WCB who has already grown substantially since our 1st dealings with the team.'
